# TaskMaster

## Lab26

### Summary

Today I created a home page that has two buttons. The add Task button is routed to the add task xml which displays two input text boxes, a total task text, and a add task button. The add task button has an onClick event listener that will change the text of a blank text box at the bottom of the screen to show submitted. The routing for the all task is also set up but no functionality at this time.
